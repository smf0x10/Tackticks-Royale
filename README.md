# Tackticks-Royale
Continued Development of an RTS I started in high school

Tacktiks Royale was the first game I ever made using the Unity Engine. 
It was ambitious for a first project, being a real-time strategy game 
using AI-controlled pawns and local multiplayer. I only sort of got it 
working, the code was a bit of a mess, and the camera system was atrocious. 
A few years later, I returned to this project and started cleaning up the 
internal components. In the process, I stripped out all the multiplayer 
elements (I plan to add them back in at a later date), and added some 
proper (if a bit simple) animations. This repository represents my progress 
thus far.

Current plans:

-Add an interface to streamline the development of new troop formations: done
-Add a "rally system" to select a group of troops and direct them to hold: working on it
a certain point
-Add an objective to win the game: not started
-Reimplement multiplayer: not started
