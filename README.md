# Tackticks-Royale
Continued Development of an RTS I started in high school

Tacktiks Royale was the first game I ever made using the Unity Engine. 
It was ambitious for a first project, being a real-time strategy game 
using AI-controlled pawns and local multiplayer. I only sort of got it 
working, the code was a bit of a mess, and the camera system was atrocious. 
A few years later, I returned to this project and started cleaning up the 
internal components. In the process, I stripped out all the multiplayer 
elements (I plan to add them back in at a later date), and added some 
proper (if a bit simple) animations. This repository represents my progress 
thus far.

Current plans:

-Add an interface to streamline the development of new troop formations: done

-Add a "rally system" to select a group of troops and direct them to hold
a certain point: done (but might improve it a bit later)

-Add an objective to win the game: done for now

-Reimplement multiplayer: started; being developed on the test branch as a lot of things are still broken

-Cleaning up in the aftermath or reimplementing multpilayer: Not started

-Add more troop types: not started

-Add a "loadout" system for troops; players can select 3-5 of the troop formations to be available to spawn: 
Not started, and there are only 3 formations in the game at the moment
